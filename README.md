# Moon Phase Approximation Benchmark

A moon phase approximation benchmark suite, comparing accuracy for different
implementations from 1900 to 2100. The timestamps considered correct are taken
from the [Astronomical Applications Department](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/)'s
API.

All algorithms (except for the orbital one) are implemented in Python.

MAE is the mean absolute error, MSE is the mean squared error, and hour switches
are changes from one hour to another, e.g. 15:59 turning into 16:00 or vice
versa. Day switches are the approximate number of 23:59 -> 00:00 switches, i.e.
the probability of a single moon phase being assigned to the wrong date in a
specific time zone. It is approximate as I don't factor in daylight savings time
switches and don't compute it for 15- and 30- minute time zones.

Note: The "Astronomical Algorithms" algorithm won't give good approximations for
waxing/waning crescent/gibbous, hence it's not an appropriate algorithm to use
if you need this.
